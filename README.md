## Boris Bikes Project
Anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London.

**Instructions**
You have to have docked a bike before you can release it. If you have a broken bike/bikes you can call a van from the docking station that will deliver the broken bike/bikes to the garage.

The garage will fix all the bikes and you can call a van to pick up the broken bikes and bring them back to your docking station.

# Focus goals
**I can TDD anything**

By the end of this week you should be able to write a meaningful test, based on the user requirements. You'll then be able to write code using TDD, to make the test pass.

**I can program fluently** 

You'll learn how to setup and structure a new Ruby project, and turn user requirements into working code.

**I can debug anything** 

You'll be introduced to a technique for uncovering the root-cause of bugs in your code. When your code doesn't work, you'll be able to apply a consistent process to resolve the issue.
